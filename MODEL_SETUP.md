# Model Setup Guide

## Problem

Your deployment failed because the `best.pt` model file is missing from the repository. Large model files (typically 20-100MB+) cannot be stored directly in Git repositories without Git LFS.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use Default YOLOv8n Model (Recommended for testing)

The application will automatically fall back to YOLOv8n if no custom model is found. This is perfect for testing the deployment.

**No action needed** - the app will work with the general-purpose YOLOv8n model.

### Option 2: Host Your Custom Model Online

1. Upload your `best.pt` file to a cloud storage service:
   - Google Drive (make sure to get the direct download link)
   - Dropbox 
   - AWS S3
   - GitHub Releases (if < 25MB)
   - Any other public file hosting

2. Update the `render.yaml` file:
   ```yaml
   envVars:
     - key: YOLO_MODEL_PATH
       value: https://your-direct-download-url.com/best.pt
   ```

3. Redeploy the application.

### Option 3: Add Model to Repository with Git LFS

1. Install Git LFS:
   ```bash
   git lfs install
   ```

2. Track the model file:
   ```bash
   git lfs track "*.pt"
   git add .gitattributes
   ```

3. Add your model:
   ```bash
   cp /path/to/your/best.pt models/
   git add models/best.pt
   git commit -m "Add custom YOLO model"
   git push
   ```

## Current Status

The application has been updated to:
- ✅ Automatically download YOLOv8n if no custom model is found
- ✅ Support downloading custom models from URLs
- ✅ Handle model fallback gracefully
- ✅ Work with [[memory:6358396]] lightweight Docker configuration

Your deployment should now work successfully!
